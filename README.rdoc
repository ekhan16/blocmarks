Blocmarks is a web application that allows people to bookmark pages via email.

The Devise gem is used for authentication.

The Heroku addon Sendgrid is used for email confirmation.

Mailgun is used to configure the email received containing a URL for bookmarking.

The Embedly gem is used to show an image of a bookmarked item.

And that's about it.  The css still needs work, but otherwise it's just about done.  Enjoy!
